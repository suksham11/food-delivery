Got it! Let's include bcrypt for password hashing in the README. Here's the updated version:

Food Delivery Website
Overview
This is a fullstack food delivery website built to provide a seamless food ordering experience. The project includes a frontend developed using React and ViteJS, and a backend developed with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application also integrates Stripe for payment processing, supports data fetching, API connections, and includes an admin panel for managing orders and users. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.

API Endpoints
User Authentication
POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user
POST /api/auth/login: Login a user
Food Items
GET /api/foods: Get all food items
POST /api/foods: Add a new food item (Admin only)
PUT /api/foods/:id: Update a food item (Admin only)
DELETE /api/foods/:id: Delete a food item (Admin only)
Orders
GET /api/orders: Get all orders (Admin only)
POST /api/orders: Place a new order
GET /api/orders/:id: Get a specific order
Payment Integration
Stripe is used for handling payments. Ensure you have your Stripe keys configured in the .env file:

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Your Stripe secret key
Payment processing is handled on the backend and the frontend communicates with the backend to complete the payment process.

Admin Panel
The admin panel allows the admin to manage food items, users, and orders. Admin routes are protected and require proper authentication.
