The frontend is developed using React and ViteJS, while the backend is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It also integrates Stripe for payment processing, supports data fetching, API connections, and includes an admin panel for managing orders and users. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
